JUST BEING YOURSELF

Do not allow value to other things more than the value of the LOVE you have for someone SPECIAL.
Being weak will do you no good, weakness never did anyone good!

Even in the deepest darkest of the time you have bear in mind that it will all be over and light 
will dawn.

Think that you are the most beautiful person in this world and create beauty around you, and feel
beauty around you.

Speak the truth as everyone wants to know the truth.Do what you think is right and be who you want
to be and who you are.  Find happiness in yourself and learn to appreciate even the littlest of
things and dont let them go un-noticed.
